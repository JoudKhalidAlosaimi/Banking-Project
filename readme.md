# Bank System
This project is a simple bank system that includes adding customers,logging into your account, depositing, withdrawing, transferring, and many more methods.


## Code I am proud of
This is a method for finding Top 3 Customer Reward. First I created a dict with all the customers account id's and
there total balance(checkings + savings). Then I sorted it in a descending order. assign a variable with only the first three
then use random to randomly choose one of the 3. Then I added a 100 as the prize to the winners checking account, finally I printed the 3 top qualified winners, with showing who won.
